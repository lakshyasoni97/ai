Hi, I'm Lakshya Soni. I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights, with a rich background in power engineering and deep expertise in AI and data science. I currently drive multimedia strategies at Network18, India's largest media firm.

From automating processes to developing cutting-edge tools for multimedia, i love exploring them all. I have a PG degree in AI & Data Science from Jio Institute and a Bachelorâ€™s in Power Engineering.

Outside of work, I'm an avid fan of anime and K-dramas, with "Naruto" being a particular favorite. Naruto's relentless determination and belief in himself inspire me to persist and strive towards my goals, both professionally and personally.

Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soni-lakshya/). or via [email](mailto:lakshyasoni97@gmail.com) to discuss AI, innovations, or the latest in anime and K-dramas!

Thank you for visiting. I'm excited to explore potential collaborations and new opportunities with you!
